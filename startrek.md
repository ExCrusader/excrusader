# Trek Accelerated
Star Trek powered by Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE), with some Stars Without Number (SWN) thrown in for the command point system for ship combat.

My current thought process for choosing FAE is that it models fiction where every main character has very similar levels of capabilities, like most ensemble tv shows, and Star Trek in particular. Everyone on the Enterprise had their specialty, but they all seemed to be able to do any other job in a pinch.

Stars Without Number was chosen because the command point ship-to-ship combat system solves the problem of how does everyone get involved in the ship combats. The essence of the system will probably be brought more inline with the rules in FAE.

## Character Creation
Character creation is the standard character creation as presented in Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE). With a character creation process that is so open, the most important consideration is keeping your character within the spirit of the source material. There is a few things to keep in mind:
- Your High Concept should represent your species and role onboard the ship. (ex. Vulcan Science Officer, Changeling Constable)
- Your trouble should be something that could reasonably come into play every game. Having an enemy on a distant world you seldom get to is a wasted Aspect.
- Special abilities are represented by Stunts (ex. Mind Meld, Change Form)

### Character Types

**Warp Field Theorist:** Because I am a Warp Field Theorist, I get +2 when I Cleverly create advantages when warp fields are involved.<br>
(may take one more stunt without reducing refresh)

**Refresh:** 3

### Attacking
> Size category equals Stress Boxes which is expressed as Shields. Consequences are expressed as systems going down.

The attacking ship's tactical officer makes a roll against the defending ships helmsman. If the attacking ship wins, the shifts generated from the hit go towards damage.

The size difference between competing ships is used as shifts when attacking an enemy ship, a minus for a larger ship attacking a smaller, and a plus for a smaller attacking a larger. The size difference is also used to determine how much damage is caused by the hit, according to the formula below. The larger ship has a harder time to hit but does more damage. The smaller ship has an easier time to hit but does less damage. The bonus or negative is given to the attacking ship.

Equal size ships: Every shift does 1 damage.<br>
Bigger Ship vs. Smaller Ship: Every shift does size difference +1 damage.<br>
Smaller Ship vs. Bigger Ship: Size difference +1 shows how many shifts it takes to do 1 damage. Excess shifts have no effect.

X Taken Out

Need to find out a way that makes various weapon and combat aspects useful. A Defiant Class ship should be able to pretty consistently hit above its weight.

Size of Attacker vs. Size of Defender | To-hit Modifier | Damage per 1 shift
------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------
0                                     | 0               | 1

Example: Defiant (2) vs. Galor (4). Same skill, same roll. Defiant would hit with 2 shifts, +4 for 2 aspects = 6 shifts = 2 damage (size indicates that it takes 3 shifts to do 1 damage).

Example: Galaxy (5) vs. Bird-of-Prey (2). Same skill, same roll. Galaxy would need to roll 4 better than the Bird-of-Prey to get 1 shift. That one shift would do 4 damage (size difference +1). The Klingons are down to 60% shields with that one hit!

Example: Runabout (1) vs. Borg Cube (10). Same skill, same roll = no damage. Roll 1 higher = 1 damage. Roll 11 higher = 2 damage. Roll 21 higher = 3 damage.

Do math for 1 ship vs. an array of different sized ships. See how much damage it will do until the enemy is destroyed and keep track of how many extra damage it will do because Consequences need to be taken into account.

#### Alternate System 1
Smaller ship attacking larger ship: +1 to hit, -2 to damage per size difference.

Larger ship attacking smaller ship: -1 to hit, +2 to damage per size difference.

Example: Defiant (2) vs. Galor (4). Same skill, same roll. +2 to hit, -4 to damage for the size difference. Defiant would hit with 2 shifts, +4 for 2 aspects -4 for the size difference = 2 damage.

Example: Galaxy (5) vs. Bird-of-Prey (2). Same skill, same roll. Galaxy would need to roll 4 better than the Bird-of-Prey to get 1 shift. That one shift would do 7 damage (size difference of +6 +1 shift). The Klingons are down to 30% shields with that one hit!

### Stuff to Do On-board

#### Repair/Boost System
Engineering check versus a set difficulty. Possibly used to get shield hits back or to mitigate consequences. Worse consequences should be harder/take longer to repair. Probably should be categorized with Transfer Power.

#### Transfer Power
Engineering or Systems Operations (Ops) check (more difficult than Engineering) versus a set difficulty. Possibly used to get shield hits back or to grant temporary Aspects on the ship. Probably should be categorized with Repair/Boost System. More difficult the more shield damage taken?

#### Fire Weapons
Systems Operations (Tactical) versus Pilot. If successful, add the difference between the ship's sizes (positive or negative) to the result. This could reduce the damage to 0, resulting in an ineffectual attack against the opposing ship's shields.

#### Use Sensors
Systems Operations check versus a set difficulty.

#### Use Science/Computer Systems
Science check versus a set difficulty.

#### Manoeuvring
Pilot check versus a set difficulty.

#### Issuing Commands
Leadership check versus a set difficulty.

#### Diplomatic/Intimidate Actions
Deceit, Intimidation, or Rapport check versus adversaries check.

### Notes on using Spin
> Does Spin still exist in FAE? It might be Boost.

Spin can be given from one character to another, even if different skills are used. For example, a successful Engineering check to boost phaser power could give Spin to the Tactical Officer to make his Systems Operations check.
