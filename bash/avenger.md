Batman like hero. Irreverent playboy making a mockery of the upper crust. Old Money hired an assassin from a secret society to take him out and make it look like suicide. It failed, leaving him barely alive, and completely changed his perspective on life. He trained like mad, including joining the secret society to learn their knowledge, before taking out the assassin and then fighting crime in his home city.
